# OTIS-WEB

These are the source files for the internal website
that I use to teach my course [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html).
It is pretty standard Django, so you should be able to spin
up a local server and play around if you so choose.

For OTIS students: pull requests welcome!
If you think the website can be improved in some way, feel free to implement it.
