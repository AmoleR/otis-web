      starting with S empty and then grabbing things to add to S while trying to avoid
      bad-ness (whatever that means for the current problem). It's then enough to

      almost like an answer extraction at the end. Rigid problems often have so few
      degrees of freedom that a lot of what you'll be doing is writing down a lot
      of concrete examples, and then trying to figure out what they have in common.
