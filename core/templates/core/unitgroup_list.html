<p>This list is sorted by olympiad category, then alphabetically by name.</p>
<p>Each topic has one or more units which is designated
by a three-letter code.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first letter of the code represents the difficulty.
		B is the easiest (IMO1-IMO2), D is medium (up to IMO3),
		Z is quite hard (mostly IMO3).
		There is some grey room in this department.</li>
	<li>The second letter repeats the olympiad category.</li>
	<li>The third letter is a version identifier (either W, X, or Y).
	Many topics have multiple versions so they can be repeated in different years.</li>
</ul>
